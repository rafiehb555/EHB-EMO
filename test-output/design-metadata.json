  "prompt": "Visual style description:\nThe healthcare dashboard should be modern, clean, and intuitive. A minimalist style would work best to keep the focus on the information and not on the design elements. The style should be professional with a medical feel to it. Use icons related to healthcare and medical field for easy understanding. The typography should be clean and easy to read. The dashboard should incorporate a mix of graphs, charts, and tables to represent data visually.\n\nColor scheme:\nThe color scheme should be based on blue and white, which are often associated with healthcare due to their connotations of cleanliness and hygiene. You can use different shades of blue for variety and depth. A subtle use of green can also be incorporated for its relation to health and restfulness. The background should be white or light grey to ensure the focus remains on the content.\n\nLayout requirements:\nThe layout of the dashboard should be grid-based, allowing for easy scanning and reading. The top of the dashboard should have a navigation bar with clearly labeled tabs for different sections. The patient's personal information and recent medical history should be positioned at the top or left side for easy access. The center of the dashboard should contain interactive graphs or charts displaying patient's health progress or medical statistics. The right side can contain a section for medical notes or reminders.\n\nUser experience considerations:\nThe dashboard should be user-friendly and intuitive even for those who are not technically savvy. The information should be organised in a hierarchical way, with the most important information being the most prominent. Hover effects can be used to offer more information about each data point in the graphs or charts. Ensure the loading time is minimal for a smooth experience. The design should be responsive to fit both desktop and mobile screens.\n\nTechnical specifications:\nThe user interface should be developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to ensure compatibility across all browsers. To make the dashboard dynamic and interactive, consider using a JavaScript library like D3.js. The dashboard should adhere to the principles of responsive design, adjusting layout based on the size of the user's screen. It should also follow accessibility guidelines to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities. All the images and icons used should be in SVG format to ensure they scale well on all screen sizes.",
